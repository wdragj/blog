> When you delete a word from a trie, the entire word (represented as a node) could be deleted, partially deleted, or not deleted at all.

> For a node to be deleted in trie, it must satisfy 2 conditions.

1. The node has to be the end of the word
2. The node has no children

If both conditions above is satisfied, a node in a trie will be deleted.
